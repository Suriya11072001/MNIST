Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN on MNIST Dataset

Key Skills: Python, PyTorch, CNN, MNIST, Deep Learning, Image Classification, Model Evaluation, Computer Vision

â€¢Developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy. Implemented the solution using PyTorch, applying image normalization, efficient data loading, and a custom CNN architecture. Incorporated ReLU activations, max pooling, and dropout layers to enhance learning and prevent overfitting. Trained the model using cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, achieving over 98% accuracy on the test set. Evaluated model performance on unseen data and visualized predictions using Matplotlib.
